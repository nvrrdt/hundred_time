###Why not 100 hours in a day, 100 minutes in an hour and 100 seconds in a minute?

People play with numbers.

In a 100 hour per day day are more possibillities to play with (more) numbers then in a 24 hour per day day, which is unfair
and also not comprehensible in a digital world.

gcc -o hundred hundred.c -lm

If you like to see an imperfect clock:

watch -n 1 -t ./hundred
